# Project Title: Industrial Copper Modeling

## Skills Takeaway From This Project
- Python scripting
- Data preprocessing
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Streamlit

## Domain
Manufacturing

## Problem Statement
The copper industry faces challenges related to skewed and noisy data affecting pricing accuracy and lead classification. This project aims to address these issues by implementing machine learning models for regression and classification, along with creating an interactive Streamlit page for predictions.

### Solution Steps
1. Exploring skewness and outliers in the dataset.
2. Transforming data into a suitable format and performing necessary cleaning and preprocessing steps.
3. Implementing ML regression model to predict 'Selling_Price'.
4. Implementing ML classification model to predict 'Status' (WON or LOST).
5. Creating a Streamlit page for interactive predictions.

## Data
- **Data-set**: [Link to Dataset]
- **About the Data**:
  - `id`: Unique identifier for each transaction/item.
  - `item_date`: Date of transaction/item recording.
  - `quantity tons`: Quantity of item in tons.
  - `customer`: Customer identifier.
  - `country`: Customer's country.
  - `status`: Transaction/item status.
  - `item type`: Category of the item.
  - `application`: Specific use/application of the item.
  - `thickness`: Thickness of the item.
  - `width`: Width of the item.
  - `material_ref`: Material reference.
  - `product_ref`: Product reference.
  - `delivery date`: Expected/actual delivery date.
  - `selling_price`: Price of the item.

## Approach
- **Data Understanding**: Identify variable types and distributions.
- **Data Preprocessing**:
  - Handle missing values.
  - Treat outliers.
  - Treat skewness.
  - Encode categorical variables.
- **EDA**: Visualize outliers and skewness.
- **Feature Engineering**: Create new features if applicable.
- **Model Building and Evaluation**:
  - Split dataset into training and testing sets.
  - Train and evaluate regression and classification models.
  - Optimize model hyperparameters.
- **Model GUI**: Create Streamlit interactive page.
